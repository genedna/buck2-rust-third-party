## Changes to `serde` serialization

**⚠️ NOTE ⚠️** This release changes the default serialization you'll get if you `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`
on your generated flags types. It will now use a formatted string for human-readable formats and the underlying bits
type for compact formats.

To keep the old behavior, see the [`bitflags-serde-legacy`](https://github.com/KodrAus/bitflags-serde-legacy) library.

[#112]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/112
[#115]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/115

## How to update your code to use associated constants
Assuming the following structure definition:
```rust
bitflags! {
  struct Something: u8 {
     const FOO = 0b01,
     const BAR = 0b10
  }
}
```
In 0.9 and older you could do:
```rust
let x = FOO.bits | BAR.bits;
```
Now you must use:
```rust
let x = Something::FOO.bits | Something::BAR.bits;
```

# 0.9.1
- Fix the implementation of `Formatting` traits when other formatting traits were present in scope ([#105])

[#105]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/105

# 0.9.0
- **[breaking change]** Use struct keyword instead of flags to define bitflag types ([#84])

- **[breaking change]** Terminate const items with semicolons instead of commas ([#87])

- Implement the `Hex`, `Octal`, and `Binary` formatting traits ([#86])

- Printing an empty flag value with the `Debug` trait now prints "(empty)" instead of nothing ([#85])

- The `bitflags!` macro can now be used inside of a fn body, to define a type local to that function ([#74])
